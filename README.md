# Flappy

This is a port to maven and the updated LWJGL version (3.1.2) of TheCherno's Flappy bird tutorial project https://github.com/TheCherno/Flappy 

Eg VM argument to configure native libraries `-Djava.library.path=lib/windows/x64`

I've included the x64 libs with this repo but if you need libs for other platforms, get from here https://www.lwjgl.org/browse and update the VM arguments appropriately.
 
This is a clone of Flappy Bird made for desktop platforms, for a video tutorial on YouTube which you can find [here](http://youtu.be/527bR2JHSR0). This video shows the narrated creation of this game from scratch, in about 3 hours including short explanations of what is being typed, and why.
